Quick Start Guide — Agent A

1. Purpose
Agent A is a local technical assistant that answers questions based on your own documentation files.
It combines keyword search (Lucene) and vector similarity (OpenAI embeddings) to retrieve the most relevant sections.

2. Requirements
- Java 17 or newer
- Maven 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Internet access for the first embedding phase

3. Project Structure
project_root/
 ├─ pom.xml
 ├─ src/
 │   └─ main/java/Agent/
 ├─ application.yaml
 ├─ docs/ or dir/
 │   ├─ troubleshooting.txt
 │   ├─ integration_tips.txt
 │   ├─ config_guide.txt
 │   └─ quick_start.txt
 └─ index/ (auto-created)

4. Environment Setup
PowerShell (Windows):
  setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

Unix (bash):
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

5. Build and Run
In the project root:
  mvn -q clean package
  java -cp target\classes Agent.App

If you built a shaded JAR:
  java -jar target\agent-a-1.0.0-shaded.jar

6. Reloading the Knowledge Base
When you add or edit files in the docs folder, type in the agent console:
  :reload
This will reindex the documents automatically.

7. Example Questions
- How do I fix embedding error 401?
- How can I set environment variables on Windows?
- Why does Agent A require at least 3 unique sources?

8. Notes
If you get “The docs folder was not found”, check:
- The folder path in application.yaml (paths.docs_dir)
- That it contains at least one .md, .txt, or .pdf file.

If you see “I cannot answer with certainty”, it means too few unique documents matched your query.
Add more documentation or clarify your question.
